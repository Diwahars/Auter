## Auter

Auter is the product of a 36 hour online hackathon - Aadhar Hackathon. It tries to make cab and rickshaw travel safer by authenticating drivers through the aadhar API and allowing users to report and alert the concerned authorities as well as their family and friends in case of an unfortunate turn of events.

Tech: Android, Parse backend

Tested on Android 4.4 Kitkat and above, devices
